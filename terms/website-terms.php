<h4>Article 4. Terms of Use - Service</h4>
    <p>It is up to the User to decide what information will be saved and/or exchanged using the Service. Trendy Publishing has no knowledge of that information. As such, the User bears responsibility for ensuring that that information is lawful and does not infringe upon any third-party rights. Trendy Publishing cannot accept any liability for the information saved and/or exchanged using the Service. The User hereby indemnifies Trendy Publishing against any claims from third parties that are based on the position that the information saved and/or exchanged by the User using the Service is unlawful.

    The User agrees not to hinder other Users or Internet users or to damage the servers. The User may not start up any processes or programs, either on the server on which the Service runs or otherwise, of which the User is aware, or may reasonably expect, that they will hinder or cause damage to other Users or Internet users.

<h4>Article 5. Intellectual Property</h4>

    <p>In the event of force majeure, which is understood to include at least internal civil unrest, mobilisation, war, traffic obstructions, strikes, lockouts, interruption of operations, stagnation of supplies, fire, flooding and restrictions on imports and exports, and in the event that Trendy Publishing is rendered incapable of providing the Services by its own suppliers, regardless of the reasons for such, as a result of which Trendy Publishing cannot within reason be required to fulfil the Agreement, the implementation of the Agreement will be suspended, or else the Agreement will be terminated if the condition of force majeure lasts longer than four weeks. None of the situations outlined above will result in any liability to pay damages.</p>

<h4>Article 8. Amendment of the Terms and Conditions</h4>
    <p>Trendy Publishing reserves the right to amend or expand these Terms and Conditions.
    Amendments will also apply to Agreements concluded previously, with due observance of a period of 30 days after the amendments are announced on the Website or by electronic notification. Minor amendments may be implemented at any time.
    If the User does not wish to accept an amendment to these Terms and Conditions, he or she may, until the date on which the new Terms and Conditions enter into force, dissolve the Agreement with effect from that date or with effect from the date on which the notice of termination is received if that date is later than that on which the amendment takes effect.</p>
