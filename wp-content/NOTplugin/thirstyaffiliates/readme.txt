= Are there any known conflicts? =
WordPress supports a very vibrant ecosystem of themes and plugins so from time to time it's expected that there will be some minor conflicts with other products.

Here is a list of known conflicts and their workarounds (if one exists):

**Bulletproof Security plugin - conflict with ThirstyAffiliates link picker not showing.**

Fix: add this to your .htaccess file in your WP root directory
`# Thirstyaffiliates skip/bypass rule
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/wp-content/plugins/thirstyaffiliates/ [NC]
RewriteRule . - [S=13]`

**WooThemes – minor conflict with image uploader being taken over by the theme. Happens with Canvas and some other WooThemes themes.**

Fix: add this to your functions.php in your theme:
`add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', 'ta_remove_wf_media_assets' );

function ta_remove_wf_media_assets ( $hook ) {
	if ( 'post.php' == $hook && 'thirstylink' == get_post_type() ) {
		remove_action( 'admin_print_styles', 'woothemes_mlu_css', 0 );
		remove_action( 'admin_print_scripts', 'woothemes_mlu_js', 0 );
	}
} // End ta_remove_wf_media_assets()`

Thanks to Matty of WooThemes for the workaround.
