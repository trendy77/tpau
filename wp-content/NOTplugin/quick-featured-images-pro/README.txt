Your time-saving Swiss Army Knife for featured images: Set, replace and delete them in bulk, in posts lists and set default images for future posts.

== Description ==

The plugin is available in English and German (Deutsch), for the most part in Spanish (Español), Brazilian Portuguese (Português do Brasil) and Arabic (العربية).

= Manage featured images quickly =

The plugin 'Quick Featured Images Pro' helps you bulk managing featured images, setting automatic default featured images to save your time. 

1. It **sets, replaces and removes featured images for hundreds of posts, pages, audios, videos and custom post types in one go**. You can run it over all contens or let it work only to desired contents by using flexible filters.
2. It **sets, replaces and removes featured images in a sortable image column** in lists of posts, pages and custom post types if they support thumbnails. So you can change the images per post quickly without leaving the posts list page.
3. It enables you to **define presets for automatic default featured images** for future posts as many as you need. You can set **accurate rules based on post properties**.

See comments under [Reviews](http://www.quickfeaturedimages.com/reviews/).

= Access =

1. You will find the plugin under the own **menu item 'Featured Images'** 
2. You can select an image in the media library with the **action link 'Bulk set as featured image'**. Click on it and you can go on with the plugin.
3. You can set in 'Settings' which **minimum user role is allowed to see the plugin** in his/her adminstration area. You can switch between 'Administrator' and 'Editor'. The default value is 'Editor'.

= Set, replace, remove: Actions =

With Quick Featured Images Pro you can apply time-saving tasks with many featured images: add, exchange and delete them in bulk.

1. **Adding featured images:** You can select an image, or scan for the first post image, or for the first image of WordPress standard galleries, or of NextGen galleries, to set it as the new featured image to hundreds of posts in one go. You can select multiple images to set them randomly as featured images.
2. **Exchanging featured images:** You can replace or update several existing featured images with a selected image in one go.
3. **Deleting featured images:** You can remove a selected featured image or all existing featured images in one go.

= Set, replace, remove: Options =

Based on your selected action you can toggle on and off some options:

1. **overwrite existing featured images** or **keeping them unchanged**. The latter setting is the default.
2. **consider only posts without a featured image**. This will hide posts with featured images in the results list and will speed up the process.
3. **remove first image in the content** after it was set as featured image.

If you want to catch the first image of a post you can switch between:

1. **the first post image** if available in the media library
2. **the first post image from the current site domain**, copy and add it to the media library if not available there
3. **the first external post image**, download it and add it to the media library
4. **the first attached image of a post**
5. **the first image of a WordPress standard gallery**
6. **the first image of a NextGen Gallery**.

If you selected multiple images to set them as featured images in random order you can add these options:

1. **Use each selected image only once**. If there are more posts than selected images the remaining posts will not be changed.
2. **Remove excess featured images** after all selected images are used.

= Set, replace, remove: Filters =

If there would be no filters Quick Featured Images Pro would affect all posts and pages without exception! In most cases this is not desired. 

The implemented filters allow you to narrow down the action to only the posts and pages you want to modify. The built-in filters are:

1. Filter by **post type**: Search by post types. By **default all** posts, pages and custom post types will be affected
2. Filter by **post format**: Search by post formats. By **default standard** posts format will be affected
3. Filter by **multimedia type**: Search for audio and video files
4. Filter by **status**: Search by several statuses (published, draft, private etc.). By **default all** statuses will be affected
5. Filter by **search**: Search by search term: Search in post title and post content or in post title only
6. Filter by **time**: Search by time specifications
7. Filter by **author**: Search by author
8. Filter by **custom taxonomy**: Search by terms of registered taxonomies of a plugin or a theme
9. Filter by **featured image size**: Search for small featured images below a given size
10. Filter by **category**: Search posts by category
11. Filter by **tag**: Search posts by tag
12. Filter by **parent page**: Search child pages by parent page

= Automatic Default Featured Images: Rules =

**You can set rules for default featured images of posts easily.** Every time you insert a new post or save an existing post Quick Featured Images Pro will look for a rule to add and to change the preset featured image to the saved post. 

For every rule you can set an single default image or multiple images for random assign per post.

You can define the rules based on

1. **first content image** if available in the media library or on an external server or **first assigned image**
2. **search string in post title**
3. **custom taxonomy** supporting featured images
4. **post tag**
5. **post category**
6. **post author**
7. **post format**
8. **post types**: 'Post', 'Page' and **custom post types** supporting featured images

The rules are easy to set: choose an image (or several random images), a taxonomy, a value and save the settings. That's it. **You do not need to code.**

You can add, change and delete every rule whenever you want. So you get an **precise set of rules** for automatic default featured images in your website.

The rules take effect when a post is saved in the backend &ndash; e.g. on the post edit page &ndash; or in the frontend &ndash; e.g. via a "Create Post" form by Gravity Forms.

= Automatic Default Featured Images: Options =

You can switch between 

1. **overwriting existing featured images**
2. **removing the first content image automatically** after the featured image was set successfully

= Easy managing in a sortable image column in posts lists =

Quick Featured Images adds a new column called 'Featured Image' in posts lists. The additional column is sortable by the image ID. It shows the currently assigned **featured image of each post** and **action links to set, replace, edit and remove the featured image at each post**.

With that column you can get a **quick overview about all used images** and a **change featured images at every single post quickly**. You can also see posts with no featured image at a glance.

Under **'Featured Images' &gt; 'Settings'** you can switch on and off the additional image column for every single post type, even custom post types if they support thumbnails.
