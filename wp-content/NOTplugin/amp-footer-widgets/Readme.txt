Extends the excellent AMP plugin (Automattic) by adding 3 widget areas in the footer of your website, and lots of goodies. 


== Description ==

Add 3 widget areas to the footer section to your AMP (accelerated Mobile Pages) content, fully marked up using Microdata(WPFooter). Additionally the plugin options page allows to add a fully marked up credits footer: copyrightYear, copyrightHolder and creator, see screenshots. Provides a handy Google Structured Data Testing Tool 1-click bookmarklet and an option to hide the native AMP footer.
