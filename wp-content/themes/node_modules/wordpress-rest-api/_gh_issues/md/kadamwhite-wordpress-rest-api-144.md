# [Add initial support for querying custom API endpoints](https://github.com/kadamwhite/wordpress-rest-api/pull/144)

This begins to address #140, by implementing an &#x60;.endpoint&#x60; method that will create and return a factory method which can create CollectionRequest instances against the provided endpoint.

Downsides to this approach:

- Somewhat duplicative w/r/t .root()
- Presumes that only resource(/:id) format collections will be used
  - Actually supporting an arbitrary structure of URL will eventually be necessary in order to support discovery-based generation; however, at present we haven&#x27;t worked out a solid approach for parsing PCRE named groups.

Upsides:

- Provides a vector to reintroduce .registerType very cleanly
- The move towards defining filter methods as independent modules will make sharing functionality between endpoints much easier!

The current plan is to merge this, get feedback, and iterate prior to making a formal decision on supporting this or using an alternative approach prior to releasing v0.7.
