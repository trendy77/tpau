# [Return a subset of superagent&#x27;s error object to error handlers?](https://github.com/kadamwhite/wordpress-rest-api/issues/124)

Superagent&#x27;s error response is very verbose, and tends to &quot;drown&quot; the actual JSON response received from the API. It might be advantageous to define our own error format that includes only a common subset of superagent&#x27;s properties, so that the response value is less dependent on the transport library (relevant if we go the route of making this library transport-agnostic or multi-transport, e.g. if you can use it in the browser with jQuery for your AJAX instead of superagent)
