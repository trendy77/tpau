# [Support mixing into or processing response data?](https://github.com/kadamwhite/wordpress-rest-api/issues/62)

It&#x27;s been suggested that we mix in Underscore/Lodash functions to collection responses (#5), and it may be beneficial to provide a way to process response data objects into more structured models. (This library does not actually provide models: we should *not* presume how users want to structure those data models, but it might be convenient to give them the option to do so.)

This issue is for brainstorming an interface for providing these models. It may not be feasible, given the variety of data types that you can retrieve even from a single endpoint (e.g. &#x60;/posts&#x60; and its descendants yields Posts, Post Collections, Comments, Revisions, and Types).

A potential consumer-facing interface for this was outlined as Option 2A in #76
