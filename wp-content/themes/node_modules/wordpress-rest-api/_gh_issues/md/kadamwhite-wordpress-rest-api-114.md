# [CPT support is not working with api v2](https://github.com/kadamwhite/wordpress-rest-api/issues/114)

The following does not work with the v2 api:
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
wp.posts().type( type_name ): get posts of custom type type_name
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

When I read this article ( http://scottbolinger.com/custom-post-types-wp-api-v2/ ) it&#x27;s clear why, the API endpoint changed.

Correct, this is a known issue. Thanks for reporting, in hoping to have a new release out by new year&#x27;s with much more support for v2!
