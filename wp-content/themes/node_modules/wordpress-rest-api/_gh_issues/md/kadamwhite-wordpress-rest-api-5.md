# [Implement lo-dash/underscore support for return values](https://github.com/kadamwhite/wordpress-rest-api/issues/5)

I had the idea of extending the return values to support lo-dash or underscore so the developer could make use of sorting functions (among everything else these libraries support).

Though, after talking with @kadamwhite - I feel that we should make this as lightweight as possible and let the developer choose how they want to take action on the return results.

Still opening the Issue for discussion on this topic.

I do this with LayoutManager when you request a collection of child views.  For instance:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; javascript
// The return value from &#x60;getViews&#x60; is a wrapped Lo-Dash/Underscore instance.
var mainView = parent.getViews().find(function(view) {
  return view.name === &quot;main&quot;;
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
