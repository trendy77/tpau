Per @rmccue, providers of the WP-API can expose new query endpoints and we should acocunt for those.

&gt; So e.g. for WooCommerce, implementing /products as a shorthand for /posts?type=products

The option we discussed was to add a &#x60;.customEndpoint&#x60; method, in the manner of &#x60;.registerType&#x60; (see #7); however, the other option would be to make a function on WP that could be used to define a new constructor and specify the types at instantiation. Worth discussing. cc @carldanley
