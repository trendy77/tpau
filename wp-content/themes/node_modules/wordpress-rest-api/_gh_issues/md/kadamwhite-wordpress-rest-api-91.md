(For background see #89)

Superagent automatically converts multiple occurrences of the same query parameter key into array syntax: &#x60;param=val&amp;param=val&#x60; becomes &#x60;param[0]=val&amp;param[1]=val&#x60;. Because this behavior was not intuitive (other request libraries use the provided URL exactly as-is), we should add a test to verify that this behavior still occurs in case it changes in future versions of superagent.

Updating issue based on a change of strategy in #89: The goal is to add some tests in which the responses of the HTTP requests are mocked, not the request library itself.
