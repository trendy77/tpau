# [Can we call custom URL via node cilent?](https://github.com/kadamwhite/wordpress-rest-api/issues/140)

Hello @kadamwhite 
I&#x27;m using **memberpress**(https://www.memberpress.com/) which provides REST api as well. I&#x27;ve installed WP API v2 and on node side i&#x27;m using your client.
However, member press API follows this format
wp-json/mp/v1/members/:id
whereas wordpress-rest-client follows this  format
wp-json/wp/v2/***
At the moment, there is no way to point memberpress apis from your client, I can use HTTP request then there is authentication. 
is it possible for me to call memberpress rest api using this node client?

I think if we can manage to call custom URLs (not via post /page/ taxonomies ) then this is will be really awesome!

thanks,
Andrei

@andreipot As discussed in #138, there&#x27;s currently not good support for this. The interface I have been hoping to implement would look like this:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
var wp = require( &#x27;wordpress-rest-api&#x27; ).site( &#x27;http://your-site.com/wp-json&#x27; );

wp.members = wp.endpoint({
  collection: &#x27;members&#x27;,
  namespace: &#x27;mp&#x27;,
  version: &#x27;v1&#x27;
});

wp.members().id( 7 )._renderURI(); // http://your-site.com/wp-json/mp/v1/members/7
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

I&#x27;d be curious for your thoughts about this interface.

After discussion with @rmccue the string &#x60;mp/v1&#x60; taken as a whole is the &quot;namespace&quot;; I have opened issue #141 to track removing the now-obsolete &quot;version&quot; method. Additionally, &quot;base&quot; is a more generic property name for defining a collection endpoint, in the event that a REST endpoint is created for a collection-less resource.

In light of these findings then the &#x60;.endpoint&#x60; method would be imagined to work as follows:
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;js
wp.members = wp.endpoint({
  base: &#x27;members&#x27;,
  namespace: &#x27;mp/v1&#x27;
});
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

@kadamwhite  Awesome, I will test it and let you know.
I think what you did is right.

@kadamwhite  for custom query request, rather than packing them as functions like wp.posts(), we&#x27;d rather have it accept custom URL led by namespace and base.

@andreipot can you elaborate or provide an example to show what you mean?
